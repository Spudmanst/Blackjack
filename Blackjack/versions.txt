Blackjack-Ver1.0.py

Game working on basic level using Blackjack rules

Improvements to be made:
- Constantly changing time.sleep, let's "def stdSleep()" so I can change in one place in future (added in 1.01)
- Option to "replay"/"retry"/"restart" after game completed

Features I would like:
- Would like custom win annoucement for getting Blackjack (i.e. picture card + ace) (added in 1.01)
- Would like 5-Card Charlie rule implimented (5 Cards under 21 is better than 21 but lower than Blackjack)
- Betting
- Mutliplayer

- Bug found, "adjustForAce" not working as intended, example game Log:
---
Dealer reveals hand: King of Clubs and 3 of Diamonds
Dealer's score = 13
Dealer receives: Ace of Hearts
Dealer's new score: 14
Dealer receives: King of Spades
Dealer's new score: 14
Dealer receives: 7 of Diamonds
Dealer's new score: 21
Dealer Wins with 21 vs your 17.

Upon reviewing existing code, function will not work as intended as the "Ace's" will continually be counted when they shouldn't be.
Example from existing code:
Ace + 9 + 3 = 23 so "adjustForAce", one Ace found, - 10, new score 13.
New card provided
Ace + 9 + 3 + Ace = 24 so "adjustForAce", two Ace found, - 20, new score 4.
TO FIX:
adjustForAce needs to manually count from scartch so it may deduct correctly.
adjustForAce no longer needs playerScore/dealerScore as input in view of change.
New code to calculate score from existing hand is improvement on existing code used to obtain starting scores, therefore replaced these as well.
TESTED NEW CODE, APPEARS TO WORK AS INTENDED.

- Added Feature - BLACKJACK message appears.
- Change when dealerScore is calculated to same time as playerScore. If either has Blackjack then the game ends much sooner.
- Added Function - slowType and slowTypeNoLine. I was getting annoyed with certain messages just appearing instantly. I have google'd if you could 
get python to type slower in the terminal and been guided to use "import sys" and "import time" (I am already using time).
- Added Feature - susSleep. I wanted to add some suspense when you have Blackjack and finding out if the dealer does or not.
