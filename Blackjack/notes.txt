Breakdown of game Blackjack
---------------------------
THE BASICS
- Game is played using standard deck of cards
- Players are pitted against all other players or against a single Dealer if present ("Dealer" is usually when gambling against the house is involved)
- Object is to reach or get as close to a score of 21 without going over
- Closest to 21 wins

RULES
- Each player is dealt 2 cards
- The sum of the player's cards equals their score
- The card's "score" is the value written on the card, i.e. 1 of Diamonds is worth 1 point, 5 of Clubs is worth 5 points, etc
- Picture cards, i.e. Jack, Queen, King, are worth 10 points.
- Ace is worth 11 points unless the total score exceeds 21, in which case they may be counted as 1 point instead.
- On their turn, players may choose to "Hit" (obtain another card) or "Stick" (end their turn)
- If a player score excees 21, they are declared "Bust" and are out of the game
- If a dealer is present, they are forced to "Stick" when their score reaches 17 or more
- Closest to 21 wins, ties are acceptable outcome

THOUGHTS TO COVERT TO CODE
- Need to create a deck of cards.
    - 4 suits (use Tuple as do not want to change values by mistake)
    - 13 valued cards (use Tuple as do not want to change values by mistake) 
- 11 different points across the cards, points 1 & 11 are interchangable on Ace. (use dictionary as we have value pairs)
- If player.score > 21 , player bust, i.e. player lose
- If dealer.score > 21 , dealer bust, i.e. player win
- When player or dealer score > 21, will need to check for Ace in hand and alter their score.
    - Need to ensure we do not accidentially loop this. Check number of "ace" in hand and if counted before
- If dealer.score >= 17 , dealer must "stick"
- If both player and dealer not "bust", highest score wins
