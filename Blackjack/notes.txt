Breakdown of game Blackjack
---------------------------
THE BASICS
- Game is played using standard deck of cards
- Players are pitted against all other players or against a single Dealer if present ("Dealer" is usually when gambling against the house is involved)
- Object is to reach or get as close to a score of 21 without going over
- Closest to 21 wins

RULES
- Each player is dealt 2 cards
- The sum of the player's cards equals their score
- The card's "score" is the value written on the card, i.e. 1 of Diamonds is worth 1 point, 5 of Clubs is worth 5 points, etc
- Picture cards, i.e. Jack, Queen, King, are worth 10 points.
- Ace is worth 11 points unless the total score exceeds 21, in which case they may be counted as 1 point instead.
- On their turn, players may choose to "Hit" (obtain another card) or "Stick" (end their turn)
- If a player score excees 21, they are declared "Bust" and are out of the game
- If a dealer is present, they are forced to "Stick" when their score reaches 17 or more
- "Double" - double the bet, take a single card then stand. Can only be done on first turn.
- "Split" - if two cards are the same, then create two hands, must place same bet again to new hand. Can only be done on first turn.
- "Surrender" - give up half the bet to retire. Can only be done on first turn. Dealer checks for Blackjack before Surrender is an option.
- Closest to 21 wins, ties are acceptable outcome

VARIATIONS
- 5 Card Charlie is a variation! 
- Between one and eight packs of cards can be used. Less decks = better for player (higher chance of scoring Blackjack)
- "Insurance" is when you can see the Dealer is starting with an Ace. If players want to insure, they pay 50% of their original bet. If the Dealer does have Blackjack
then the player gets their original bet and their insurance money back (i.e. they win a 2:1 stake on the insurance bet). If the dealer doesn't have Blackjack then the
insurance money is lost and you continue playing as normal.
- "Soft 17" is when you have an Ace and 6 to start with. Casinos print either S17 or H17 on the table to show what the dealer must do in the situation of having a Soft 17.
If H17, dealer must "hit", whereas S17 = "stand". S17 benefits the player
- Early Surrender allows the players to surrender before the dealer checks for Blackjack
- Resplitting - Alows you to split again if you have already "split", then got the same two value cards again in one of the hands. If playing with more than one deck
then usually there is a rule to how many times you can resplit (usually its four).
- No double after split (does exactly what it says) gives the house an advantage
- "Reno rule" only allows Doubling down on permitted hard totals of 9, 10 or 11 (in Europe its only 10 or 11). Reno rule benefits the house.
- "No hole card" mean that the Dealer doesn't reveal their Blackjack until after all players have finished. This allows for players to spend more money (splits and doubles) 
where they will not win as the dealer could have Blackjack and the players doesn't know it.
- Original Bets Only (OBO) is where you only forfeit your original bet if the dealer has Blackjack after playing "No hole card" ruling. "Additional" bets is when a player has 
Doubled or split (basically any action where you place more chips on the table after receiving your first two cards)
- Dealer wins ties.
- Altered payouts for Blackjack: 3:2 is standard, 6:5 and 1:1 are also used. (need to consider 5 Card Charlie payout, keep as standard?)

THOUGHTS TO COVERT TO CODE
- Need to create a deck of cards.
    - 4 suits (use Tuple as do not want to change values by mistake)
    - 13 valued cards (use Tuple as do not want to change values by mistake) 
- 11 different points across the cards, points 1 & 11 are interchangable on Ace. (use dictionary as we have value pairs)
- If player.score > 21 , player bust, i.e. player lose
- If dealer.score > 21 , dealer bust, i.e. player win
- When player or dealer score > 21, will need to check for Ace in hand and alter their score.
    - Need to ensure we do not accidentially loop this. Check number of "ace" in hand and if counted before
- If dealer.score >= 17 , dealer must "stick"
- If both player and dealer not "bust", highest score wins
