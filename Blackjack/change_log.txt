Blackjack-Ver 1.0.py
----------
Game working on basic level using Blackjack rules

Improvements to be made:
- Constantly changing time.sleep, let's "def stdSleep()" so I can change in one place in future (added in 1.01)
- Option to "replay"/"retry"/"restart" after game completed

----------
Blackjack-Ver 1.01.py
----------
- Bug found, "adjustForAce" not working as intended, example game Log:
---
Dealer reveals hand: King of Clubs and 3 of Diamonds
Dealer's score = 13
Dealer receives: Ace of Hearts
Dealer's new score: 14
Dealer receives: King of Spades
Dealer's new score: 14
Dealer receives: 7 of Diamonds
Dealer's new score: 21
Dealer Wins with 21 vs your 17.
---
Upon reviewing existing code, function will not work as intended as the "Ace's" will continually be counted when they shouldn't be.
Example from existing code:
Ace + 9 + 3 = 23 so "adjustForAce", one Ace found, - 10, new score 13.
New card provided
Ace + 9 + 3 + Ace = 24 so "adjustForAce", two Ace found, - 20, new score 4.
TO FIX:
adjustForAce needs to manually count from scartch so it may deduct correctly.
adjustForAce no longer needs playerScore/dealerScore as input in view of change.
New code to calculate score from existing hand is improvement on existing code used to obtain starting scores, therefore replaced these as well.
TESTED NEW CODE, APPEARS TO WORK AS INTENDED.
---
- Added Feature - BLACKJACK message appears.
- Change when dealerScore is calculated to same time as playerScore. If either has Blackjack then the game ends much sooner.
- Added Function - slowType and slowTypeNoLine. I was getting annoyed with certain messages just appearing instantly. I have google'd if you could 
get python to type slower in the terminal and been guided to use "import sys" and "import time" (I am already using time).
- Added Feature - susSleep. I wanted to add some suspense when you have Blackjack and finding out if the dealer does or not.

----------
Git and Github review - NOTE TO SELF ON FIRST USE OF GITHUB
----------
I have checked the repository is working as intended. I can see that by changing the filename of Blackjack.py, you cannot easily see the changes made
as it "removes" everything from the old and then "adds" everything from the new as a completely seperate file. Will keep the filename constant in
future.

----------
Blackjack-Ver 1.02.py
----------
- Added Feature - Multiplayer.
- Added Dictionary - player_win - Purpose of this is to assist with future features, such as Betting. We specifically record when a player obtains
Blackjack as this pays out more than regular wins. 
- Cleaner code - Adding multiplayer required and overhaul of the coding in most areas. This allowed for certain areas to be reviewed again and tidied
if needed. Examples - Line 24: Creating cards has now been condensed into one line instead of the previous 5 lines. - Line 96: condense 
"if action == _ or action == _:" to "if action in ("hit", "h"):

----------
Blackjack-Ver 1.03.py
----------
- Noticed dealerScore and many other functions has different naming structure compared to player_score (which I think the latter is easier to read)
therefore have changed to dealer_score (as well as all the others) to bring inline.
- Apparently I didn't test as well as I thought, errors calculating winners. Dealer busts but still classes the players as losing. Code amended.
- During testing had a starting hand with two Aces which the game considered "Bust". Reviewed code, adjust_for_aces doesn't happen until after the scores are first
calculated, so have amended so it will adjust_for_aces when it first calculates a score.
- In view of upcoming "Betting", realised we need the game to be able to loop, so the game is now "def start_game()" 
- Felt we had too many std_sleep, slowing the game too much so removed some (mainly when player is dealt new card)
- Noticed during testing with 7 players and replaying that the deck of cards would expire. The creation of a shuffled deck of cards is now its own
function (create_shuffled_deck()) and is called at the beginning of start_game().
- Rename versions.txt to change_log.txt, feels more appropriate.

----------
Blackjack-Ver 1.0.4.py
----------
- After having a chat with some people I know who code for a living, I've been advised to look up "Semantic Versioning", i.e. software versioning.
I have reviewed and understand that my numbering sequence is not quite right because I would consider adding Multiplayer a Major update, so at that point
I should have called it Ver 2.0.0. Then after finding the bug introduced within the Multiplayer update, the fix or "hot patch" would have been version 2.0.1.
For now I will try and use Semantic Versioning to the best of my knownledge.
- I've also been advised that my "change_log" is not really required as GitHub can easily fulfill this role as long as you update frequently and often. So I will
also attempt this moving forward, however I do wish to keep my change_log for now.
- Noticed numOfPlayers, aceCount and newCard are not using same naming structure, so have renamed accordingly (I <3 F2)

----------
Blackjack-Ver 1.0.5.py
----------
- Decided anything printed on the terminal that is not the game progressing forward, i.e. errors, does not need to be slow_typed.
- Created ASCII art for beginning of game

----------
Blackjack-Ver 1.1.0.py
----------
- ADDED FEATURE - ROUNDS - In view of upcoming "Betting" feature, thought it would make sence to have a number of rounds be played, therefore allowing
players to carry over their "credits" from round to round without resetting. 
- After more testing, found that I had too many "start_game" loops happening, causing an issue when rounds was introduced. The game would play correctly first time,
then the second time the game would play correctly but immediately start a third game without prompting for "Replay or Exit". Solution was to replace start_game()
with "continue" if "replay" or "r" was selected.
- Removed new line from asking if player wants to Hit or Stick, felt like the page was getting flooded.

----------
Blackjack-Ver 1.1.1.py
----------
- Re-orderd "def" to be in alphabetical order except start_game() which remains last in the list
- Sped up game if Dealer has Blackjack by revealing it straight away and checking if any player can match.
- Found final loop asking to replay or exit not working. If user didn't type anything valid, it would advise and the start a new game anyway. Fixed by creating
an inner loop which needs to be broken out of or sys.exit().

----------
Blackjack-Ver 1.2.0.py
----------
- Previous update checked with Dealer Blackjack earlier on, so have removed the same check later (lines 188 - 190)
- Implimented 5-Card Charlie rule, tested and appears to work as intended.

----------
Blackjack-Ver 2.0.0.py
----------
- Betting has been implimented, tested and appears functional. Betting takes into consideration the type of win and credits
the player accordingly.
- ADDED on "todo" 
    - Skips player turn if cannot bet.
    - Provide scoreboard when game is over (in order)
    - Allow players to name themselves

----------
Blackjack-Ver 2.0.1.py
----------
- Altered line asking for how much to bet to include remaining cash.
- Altered hard coded constants (number of players, starting cash, number of rounds) to be varibles for easy edits later if needed
- Although player_payout appears working as intended, found varible was being set as the string "False" if dealer had blackjack and player didn't 
(line 183). Have set this to be the boolean value False instead to match rest of game.
- Added more comments to help advise what each part of the code does if it is not clear just by reading.
- Multi line comment 249 - 252 as suspect this code is not being used. Will not delete yet just in case I have missed why I typed it to begin with.

----------
Blackjack-Ver 2.1.0.py
----------
- Game now skips players if they did not place a bet

----------
Blackjack-Ver 2.1.1.py
----------
- Created def sleep_line() as many areas of coding had both std_sleep and divide_line, so new def merges the two
- Amended fault within player_payment as elif win == "Push" or "did_not_bet" is not valid and caused winning hands to not be paid. Now corrected to
elif win == "Push" or win == "did_not_bet" ( I swear I test things...)

----------
Blackjack-Ver 2.2.0.py
----------
- Created helper function to auto format player_cash when printing out.
- Re-ordered the beginning def as not all were in alphabetical order.
- NEW FEATURE - Print out final scores in decending order.

----------
Blackjack-Ver 2.2.1.py
----------
- Decided previous patch number is incorrect, however will keep as it is now.
- New Helper function to assist with printing out how much was won / lost to an acceptable format.
- Minor tweak to format_cash, added $ so I don't need it within the formatted string it is being used in.
- NEW FEATURE - Prints out how much was won or lose when advising if the player had won or not.
- Added sleep_line after showing who won and how much, makes it easier to see when game is showing their current total cash.
- Tweaked showing remaining balance so it doesn't show at the end of final round as the Final Scoreboard is going to be displayed.
- Tweaked Calculate Winners to have specific line if player loses to Dealer's Blackjack.

----------
Blackjack-Ver 2.3.0.py
----------
- Noticed error appears when you start the program however is hidden in terminal due to ASCII art pushing the error out of view. Error is: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\|'
The ASCII art is causing this error because the string is a formatted string. A quick search engine lookup has advised to change this to a "raw" string using the prefix r.
The error no longer seems to appear with this change.
- While re-working existing code to have a class called Player, noticed that the function "adjust_for_aces" is an inaccurate name as it can be used to "calculate_score"
regardless of the scenario. Therefore have renamed to "calculate_score" and optimised further coding to utilise this.
- NEW CLASS - Player - after reviewing the code, I have no idea why I did not create a player class from the beginning. I have amended the code to now use the player class
as it makes things alot easier to read and work with. 
- NEW FEATURE - Player names - players can now name themselves if they wish to.
- Amending wording to read "please enter a whole number" if a player tries to bet a float, helps the player understand the fault better.

----------
Blackjack-Ver 2.4.0.py
----------
- Implimentation of dealer skipping their go if all players are out either due to busting or not betting.
- Implimentation of dealer skipping their go if all players have Blackjack and dealer doesn't.
- Fixed message advising how a player lost when losing to dealer's Blackjack (message which shows how much they lost)
- Re-ordered Calculate Winners to try and optimise. 
- Removed checking if player had a bet of 0 and setting to "did_not_bet" as this is previously already done when game checks if they can bet or not.
Currently it is mandatory for players to bet if they are able.
- Noticed areas of duplication, therefore merged coding where possible to streamline and tidy up.
- Swapped "std_sleep" and "divide_line" within "sleep_line as order was wrong, making the dividers look weird
- When asking for input, text generated by game is also slow_type like rest of game.
- If all players are out then game ends early.
- Deleted outdated function

----------
Blackjack-Ver 2.4.1.py
----------
- Remembered I was cleaning the win status of players at the end of the round, therefore have moved all the "resetting" of player status to the end of the game. 
I feel like it makes sense to clean at the end rather than the beginning of the next. Have also turned this into its own function to clean up the code.
- Added player.in_game and player.active, these are used to help skip players, end the game early and help make the code more readable.
- "did_not_bet" is no longer required and therefore been removed.

----------
Blackjack-Ver 2.4.2.py
----------
- Created modules folder and moved aspects of the game into said file. This is to help reduce the size of the main Blackjack.py as well as allow development of 
different aspects of the game to be made within having to edit the main Blackjack.py file
