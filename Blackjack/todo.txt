SCRAPPED IDEAS:
- More suspense if all players have Blackjack and seeing if dealer can match if card visible is Ace, picture or 10. Scrapped because we have a different
sequence of events if the dealer has Blackjack as they instantly reveal they do. So by default, players will know Dealer doesn't have Blackjack unless we
change the order of events, which doesn't really work as the purpose of the dealer showing they have Blackjack is to speed up the game.
