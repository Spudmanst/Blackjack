Blackjack-Ver1.0.py

Game working on basic level using Blackjack rules

Improvements to be made:
- Constantly changing time.sleep, let's "def stdSleep()" so I can change in one place in future
- Option to "replay"/"retry"/"restart" after game completed

Features I would like:
- Would like custom win annoucement for getting Blackjack (i.e. picture card + ace)
- Would like 5-Card Charlie rule implimented (5 Cards under 21 is better than 21 but lower than Blackjack)
- Betting
